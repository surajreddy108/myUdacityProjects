Q1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

- Instead of accessing Application server with public-private key based authentication process use AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service for accessing application server.
- Restrict the IPs that are allowed to communicate to application server by providing exact IPs.


Q2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

-   Use least privileged access.
-   Use IAM roles instead.
-   Enable server side encryption in the S3 bucket.
