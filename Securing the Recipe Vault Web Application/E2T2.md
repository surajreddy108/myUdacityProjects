Q1. Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

-   Instead of allowing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 better restrict it to particular IPs.
-   On instance "Web Service Instance - C3", UDP port 20/UDP port 547 is reachable from the internet.


  Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

-   Least priviledge should be given to the users accessing instances.
-   Use AWS Systems Manager for more secured access of instances.
