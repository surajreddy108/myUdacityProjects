Q1. Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security. Include justification.



- Both subnets in the VPC have ingress rules from all IPs on all Ports.This can cause malicious intrusion and data loss and corruption.

- Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. 

- Application server should be able to access to Free Receipe Bucket and not any other, we have to modify the instance role policy accordingly.
