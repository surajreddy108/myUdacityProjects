-   No,the permissions have to made in least priviledge way to make it more secure..

Q3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

-   No, applying default encryption will not encrypt all the existing files. You would need to go back and encrypt all the files that were present prior to enabling encryption.

Q4. What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

- If those templates are again applied then all the security changes/risks that were corrected will again come back .
